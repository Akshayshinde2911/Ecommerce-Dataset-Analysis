# Ecommerce-Dataset-Analysis

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of an eCommerce dataset using SQL and Python. The goal is to extract key insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance, which can be used to make data-driven decisions for improving business outcomes.

## 2. Data Overview

The dataset consists of multiple CSV files, representing different aspects of the business:
*
    Customers.csv: Contains customer details and location.
    Orders.csv: Includes purchase dates, order statuses, and timestamps.
    Sellers.csv: Represents details of sellers on the platform.
    Products.csv: Lists product details such as category, price, etc.
    Geolocation.csv: Provides geolocation data of customers for regional analysis.

Key variables include order IDs, customer IDs, product categories, purchase dates, and transaction amounts.


## 3. Methodology

 *  Data Loading and Cleaning: The data was loaded using Python libraries and connected to a MySQL database for querying.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): SQL queries were executed to extract insights from the data. Data was visualized using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for enhanced understanding.

Key Techniques Used:

*    SQL Queries: To extract and aggregate data for analysis.
     Visualization: Bar plots, time series charts to visualize trends.
     Analysis of missing data: Handling missing timestamps and product categories for robust analysis.

## 4. Analysis

   Analysis of various business problems and and visualising the results to showcase them in an understanding manner.

## 5. Results

 Top Sales Period: The highest number of orders were observed in the middle of the year (May and June), indicating that targeted promotions during this time could increase sales.
    Regional Insights: By analyzing the geographical data, key locations with the highest number of customers can be targeted for regional marketing and optimizing delivery operations.

## 6. Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, several key recommendations can be made:
*
    Marketing Strategy: Focus marketing campaigns during the peak sales periods (May and June), while exploring ways to increase sales in typically lower months like September.
    Regional Focus: Invest in logistics and marketing efforts in regions with high customer density.
    Product Recommendations: Further analysis of product categories could help understand which items perform best during these months, guiding inventory planning.
